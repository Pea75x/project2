# Project 2

Project 2 on the GA Software Engineering Immersive course was to build a React application that consumes a public API.

This project was paircoded with [gabriel-arafa](https://github.com/gabriel-arafa).

Unfortunately we are unable to deploy our app due to using a http API but I have included plenty of images to demonstrate.
